This enables delta sync, reducing redundant data transfer.\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Update `subscribe(sessionId:)` to call `getNewestCachedMessageId`\n- [ ] Include `last_message_id` in subscribe message if available\n- [ ] Log whether delta sync is being used\n- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility (message still valid without last_message_id)\n\n## Technical Approach\n- File to modify: `ios/VoiceCode/Managers/VoiceCodeClient.swift`\n- In `subscribe(sessionId:)`:\n  1. Call getNewestCachedMessageId(sessionId:)\n  2. Build message dictionary with type and session_id\n  3. If lastMessageId exists, add \"last_message_id\" key\n  4. Log delta sync status\n  5. Send message\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: \"Implement iOS getNewestCachedMessageId function\"\n- Requires: \"Update subscribe handler to use delta sync algorithm\" (backend must accept the field)\n\n## Verification\n- [ ] Manual test: Subscribe message includes last_message_id when messages exist\n- [ ] Manual test: Subscribe message omits last_message_id when no cached messages\n- [ ] Console logs show delta sync status\n- [ ] Backend receives and logs last_message_id\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Subscribe with `last_message_id` returns only newer messages\n- Subscribe without `last_message_id` returns recent messages (backward compatible)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-31T17:09:46.221114-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-01T09:40:00.041412-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-01T09:40:00.041412-06:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"voice-code-message-too-long-hfn.5","depends_on_id":"voice-code-message-too-long-hfn.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-31T17:09:52.114723-06:00","created_by":"travisbrown"},{"issue_id":"voice-code-message-too-long-hfn.5","depends_on_id":"voice-code-message-too-long-hfn.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-31T17:09:52.521672-06:00","created_by":"travisbrown"}]}
