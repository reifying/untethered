Generate Xcode project and verify it opens without errors\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### New Files\n- `ios/VoiceCodeMac/Info.plist` - macOS app metadata (bundle ID, version, SwiftUI lifecycle)\n- `ios/VoiceCodeMac/VoiceCodeMac.entitlements` - App Sandbox, network client, audio input\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `ios/project.yml` - Add VoiceCodeMac target with:\n  - Platform: macOS\n  - Deployment target: 15.0 (per design document line 388)\n  - Sources pointing to shared VoiceCode/ and VoiceCodeMac/\n  - Excludes for iOS-only files (DeviceAudioSessionManager.swift)\n  - Test target VoiceCodeMacTests excluding iOS-only tests\n\n### Dependencies\nNone - this is the foundation task.\n\n## Verification\n1. Run `make generate` successfully\n2. Open VoiceCode.xcodeproj in Xcode\n3. Select VoiceCodeMac scheme\n4. Build succeeds (may have warnings, but no errors blocking compilation)\n5. App launches and shows main window\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] VoiceCodeMac/ directory exists with Info.plist and entitlements\n- [ ] project.yml includes VoiceCodeMac and VoiceCodeMacTests targets\n- [ ] macOS deployment target is 15.0\n- [ ] `make generate` completes without errors\n- [ ] Xcode opens project and shows both iOS and macOS schemes\n- [ ] macOS target builds (compilation succeeds)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-02T18:38:57.171976-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-02T18:47:42.092492-06:00","source_repo":"."}

All 7 files compile for both platforms\n2. No UIPasteboard or UINotificationFeedbackGenerator references remain\n3. Copy functionality works in iOS Simulator\n4.
