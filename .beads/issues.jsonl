Implements persistent sidebar navigation, push-to-talk voice input, command palette, proper Settings scene, menu bar quick access, and information density adjustments while maintaining voice-first identity.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Sidebar persists while viewing conversation (NavigationSplitView)\n2. Push-to-talk works with Option+Space anywhere in app\n3. Command palette opens with Cmd+K and supports fuzzy search\n4. Settings opens as separate window via Cmd+,\n5. Menu bar icon shows connection status and enables quick voice capture\n6. Information density is higher than iOS (smaller spacing, more visible content)\n7. All keyboard shortcuts documented in menu items\n8. iOS functionality remains unchanged (no regressions)\n9. Session switching possible without losing conversation context\n10. Voice input works seamlessly via both click and keyboard\n\n## Implementation Phases\n- Phase 1: Navigation Foundation (NavigationSplitView, SessionSidebarView)\n- Phase 2: Settings \u0026 Keyboard (Settings scene, .commands{} shortcuts)\n- Phase 3: Push-to-Talk (PushToTalkModifier, RecordingIndicator)\n- Phase 4: Command Palette (CommandPaletteView)\n- Phase 5: Menu Bar Extra (MenuBarContentView, sendQuickPrompt)\n- Phase 6: Polish (DesktopDensity, hover states)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"/polecats/","created_at":"2026-01-08T23:38:00.904161-06:00","created_by":"travisbrown","updated_at":"2026-01-09T12:57:14.866403-06:00"}
