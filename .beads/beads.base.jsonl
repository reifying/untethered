Since `QRScannerView.swift` is excluded from the macOS target (uses UIViewController and AVCaptureSession), `APIKeySection.swift` needs platform conditionals to hide QR scanning UI on macOS.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Add #if os(iOS) conditionals around QRScannerView usage\n2. Hide \"Scan QR Code\" button on macOS\n3. Hide \"Update Key\" button (which opens scanner) on macOS\n4. Manual key entry remains the only option on macOS\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `ios/VoiceCode/Views/APIKeySection.swift`\n\n### Changes\n```swift\n// Hide scanner sheet on macOS\n#if os(iOS)\n.sheet(isPresented: $showingScanner) {\n    QRScannerView(...)\n}\n#endif\n\n// In notConfiguredKeyView, hide scan button on macOS\n#if os(iOS)\nButton(action: { showingScanner = true }) {\n    HStack {\n        Text(\"Scan QR Code\")\n        ...\n    }\n}\n#endif\n\n// In configuredKeyView, hide update button on macOS\n#if os(iOS)\nButton(action: { showingScanner = true }) {\n    HStack {\n        Text(\"Update Key\")\n        ...\n    }\n}\n#endif\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n- Depends on: voice-code-desktop3-yfz.2 (QRScannerView must be excluded first)\n- Can run in parallel with: yfz.3-9\n\n## Verification\n1. macOS target compiles without QRScannerView references\n2. iOS target still shows QR scanning options\n3. macOS shows only manual key entry\n4.

Messages over 20KB are truncated with marker showing size\n5. Response never exceeds client's max message size setting\n6.
