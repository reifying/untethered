When enabled, generates a new UUID and sends it to the backend, which creates the session automatically. User receives confirmation alert and can navigate to the new session from the Sessions list.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Toggle labeled \"Start in new session\" appears in RecipeMenuView above the recipe list\n2. Toggle defaults to OFF (disabled) each time the sheet opens\n3. When toggle is ON and recipe selected:\n   - New lowercase UUID is generated\n   - `start_recipe` WebSocket message contains the new UUID as `session_id`\n   - Confirmation alert appears with title \"Recipe Started\"\n   - Alert message indicates recipe is in a new session\n   - User must tap OK to dismiss the sheet\n4. When toggle is OFF and recipe selected:\n   - Current session ID is used in `start_recipe` message\n   - Sheet dismisses automatically after `recipe_started` confirmation (existing behavior)\n5. New session appears in Sessions list within a few seconds via existing replication\n6. New session has the same working directory as the session where the recipe was initiated\n7.
