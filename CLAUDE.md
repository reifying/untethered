We track work in Beads instead of Markdown. Run `bd quickstart` to see how.

This is October 2025 or later.

We don't care about work duration estimates. Don't provide estimates in hours, days, weeks, etc. about how long development will take.

Do not write implementation code without also writing tests. We want test development to keep pace with code development. Do not say that work is complete if you haven't written corresponding tests. Do not say that work is complete if you haven't run tests. Running tests and ensuring they all pass is required before completing any development step. By definition, development is not "done" if we do not have tests proving that the code works and meets our intent.

See @STANDARDS.md for coding conventions.
