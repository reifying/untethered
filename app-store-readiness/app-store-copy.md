## Description (4000 characters max)

**Final Version:**

```
Untethered brings voice control to Claude Code, enabling hands-free AI-powered development from your iPhone. Work with your AI coding assistant anywhere, using natural speech instead of typing.

Transform your iPhone into a powerful voice interface for Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant. Whether you're away from your desk, doing a code review on the go, or prefer hands-free interaction, Untethered gives you the full power of Claude Code through your voice.

KEY FEATURES

• Push-to-Talk Voice Input
Hold the microphone button to speak, release to send. Your voice is transcribed instantly using Apple's on-device Speech Recognition—no internet required for transcription.

• Auto-Read Responses
Toggle automatic text-to-speech playback of Claude's responses. Choose from 100+ high-quality voices. Continue playback even when your device is locked.

• Session Sync Across Devices
Start a conversation on your iPhone and continue in the Terminal, or vice versa. Sessions are automatically synced via filesystem watching, ensuring seamless continuity across all your devices.

• Smart Message Filtering
Only see the messages that matter. Untethered hides Claude's internal tool outputs and system messages, showing you clean, readable conversations.

• Multi-Project Organization
Organize sessions by directory. Work across multiple codebases and projects, each with their own conversation history.

• Session Management
Compact long conversations to reduce token usage. Delete old sessions. Search and filter by project. Full CoreData persistence means your history is always available offline.

• Command Execution
Execute shell commands and Makefile targets directly from the app. Real-time output streaming with full command history (7-day retention).

• Remote Access Ready
Works anywhere via VPN (Tailscale recommended). Connect to your backend server from home, office, or on the go with secure WebSocket connections.

PERFECT FOR

• Developers who want hands-free coding while mobile
• Voice-driven code reviews and pair programming
• Quick prompts without context switching
• Remote development workflows
• Accessibility-first development practices
• Multi-device workflows (iPhone + Mac)

HOW IT WORKS

Untethered connects to your own backend server running the voice-code Clojure service. Your backend communicates with Claude Code CLI and manages session persistence. Your iPhone becomes a voice-controlled client for your existing Claude development environment.

Voice recordings are processed entirely on your device using Apple's Speech Framework. Text transcriptions are sent to your configured backend server. No data is shared with the app developer or third parties.

REQUIREMENTS

• Backend server running voice-code (open source Clojure app)
• Claude Code CLI installed and configured on your server
• Network access to your backend (local network or VPN)
• iOS 18.5 or later

PRIVACY & SECURITY

• Voice processing happens on-device (Apple Speech Framework)
• No third-party analytics or tracking
• No cloud services controlled by the app developer
• Data stays on your device and your server
• Open source for full transparency

OPEN SOURCE

Untethered is open source software. Review the complete source code, contribute features, or run your own fork:
github.com/910labs/voice-code

Built by developers, for developers. Your voice, your server, your code.

## Age Rating

**Recommended:** 4+ (Ages 4 and Up)

**Rating Questionnaire Responses:**

| Question | Response | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Cartoon/Fantasy Violence | None | No violence |

**Content Description:**
- Professional developer tool
- User-generated content limited to text prompts sent to Claude AI
- Claude AI has built-in content filtering (Anthropic Constitutional AI)
- Command execution requires user's own server (sandboxed)
